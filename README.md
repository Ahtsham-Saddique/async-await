📘 JavaScript Async & Await Learning Project

This project contains multiple scripts demonstrating how JavaScript asynchronous behavior works using async/await, Promises, and sequential execution.
The goal is to understand how asynchronous functions run, how they pause using await, and how JavaScript handles tasks over time.

🚀 What This Project Covers

Understanding asynchronous programming in JavaScript

Using async functions for cleaner async logic

How await pauses execution until a Promise returns

Sequential execution of asynchronous tasks

Calling asynchronous functions multiple times

Basics of Promise creation and resolution

Concepts of IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) in async context

📂 Files Included

index.html — Main HTML file linking all script files

script.js — Contains async/await based sequential data fetching

script2.js — Contains async function calling repeated asynchronous tasks

iefi_concept.js — Demonstrates async IIFE usage

🧠 Key Learning Outcomes

By exploring this project, you will learn:

How async/await improves readability over Promise chaining

How asynchronous code executes step-by-step

How JavaScript waits for async tasks to complete

How multiple async calls can be handled in order

How to organize asynchronous logic efficiently

▶️ How to Run

Clone or download the repository

Open index.html in any browser

Open the Developer Console (F12 → Console)

Observe the asynchronous output from the scripts
